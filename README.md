# create_photo_array

This program creates some pages for my website to display my artwork.
Thought I would upload it here for anyone who is interested how it was done.

To use this program use the following arguments

to generate thumbnails for my site use:

	$ create_photo_array path

to generate for a directory on your site use:

	$ create_photo_array path url

so like this

	$ create_photo_array . http://lostsidedead.biz/folder/on/my/site

and finally to generate just html pages use

	$ create_photo_array path http://mysite.com/folder/ nothumb
